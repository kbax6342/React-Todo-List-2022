# React-Todo-List-2022
This application was created to highlight the skillset I have to integrate vanilla javascript, css styling, and incorporating a service.
The instructions to use the application are as follows:
The user my either enter a user and password to enter the application or they may use google authentication to enter the application
To enter the application the backend must be started by running: node server.js
The front end react application must be started by running: npm start


 I had trouble starting the applicatoin when I transfered computers. I suggest deleting the package-lock.json file and running npm install again if you run into any errors.
 
The application is composed of:
- Login Screen
- List making component
- Input box
- Enter submit button
- CSS styling
